I would like to find out if it is possible to accurately predict where in the world a seismographic sample is based purely on the sample itself. (Perhaps there is some property of the stone in the area or something that leaves a trace). It could be a useful thing to know if, for instance, some data is lost and the location of a sample is unknown. Or maybe to see if you can understand associated material compositions. (I don't actually understand geology well enough to do that much but you know). I honestly think it might be possible, but I also don't think that I will likely be able to create such an algorithm with my current knowledge. My primary dataset is 97G of seismographs and some associated metadata. I intend to do this by comparing the seismographuc data in areas with similar geologic makeup to see if there are any common features to the data.
